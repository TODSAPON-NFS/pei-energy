The code here is created as part of an effort to gather and widely distribute public data in open formats about the demand for and generation of energy in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island.

The basic idea is that if this information is more widely available we can all become more aware of energy issues on a population-wide level, and that we can begin to become smarter about generation and usage.
