Maritime Electric Transactions: Grab and Visualize
==================================================

The scripts here are designed to allow customers of Maritime Electric, the electricity provider in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island, to download and visualize their electricity transactions by programmatically pulling transaction data from the Maritime Electric Customer Portal (https://secure.maritimeelectric.com/).

These scripts work by programmatically simulating a regular browser login to the Customer Portal; this isn't a project of Maritime Electric, simply enabling technology I created for myself, as a customer, and am releasing to others.
